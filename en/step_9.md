In this step, you can get creative by adding textures, drawings, text, and any other artwork you want to include in your flatgame.

1. Upload a new sprite and name it "artwork 1".

Use one of your drawings or a photo you have taken.

2. Remove any background you don't want â€” this has a collage effect so don't be too neat!

5. Add this code so that the artwork sprite moves in the same way as the background.

```blocks3
+when flag clicked
+forever
set x to (move x)
set y to (move y)
```

6. Resize and position the sprite. You can zoom in and out with the - and +. 

For best results, position the artwork sprite at the edges of the paint window, so that your player sprite can explore the artwork further.

7. Add text to tell the story of your artwork or images.

This can be playful. You could:

- Write a few words about why you chose it
- Describe it
- Repeat and overlap words

Change the colours, size, and position of the text.
