## Challenge

Flatgames are a great way to be creative and try new things out with scratch. Try some of these challenges for next steps - and don't worry about making it neat!

Here are some ideas - have a play! What else can you add? 

Add start text
---task---
Make a paint sprite and call it "start text"
---/task---


---task---
In the costume tab, add text and position so that it can be seen - somewhere near the centre should work well.
---/task---


---task---
In the code tab add the following code to show and hide the start text

```blocks3
+When flag clicked
+show

+when [any v] key pressed
+wait (0.2) seconds
+hide
```
---/task---

Add more thing sprite

---task---
Duplicate the thing sprite and name it thing 2
---/task---

---task---
Upload a new costume and edit it in the same way as they thing 1.

You won't need to add more code - as this will be the same for all things

Hoe many things do you have in your flatgame?
---/task---

Change layer of things
---task---
It can be fun for the main spite to walk under and over the things. 

In the thing sprite add the layer order block under the green flag event.

```blocks3
+go to [front v] layer
```
---/task---

Animate the things
---task---
You could animate some of the things to add movement to the flatgame

Duplicate the thing 1 costume. 

Move the new costume very slightly, this will be the next sequance in the animation
---/task---

---task---
Add the follow code to a new flag event

```blocks3
+when flag clocked
+forever
next costume
wait (1) seconds
```

You can change the wait time to slow down or speed up the animation 
---/task---
