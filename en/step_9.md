In this step you can get creative adding textures, drawings, text, or any other artwork that you want to complete your flatgame.

Upload a new sprite and name it "artwork 1"

Use one of your drawings or a photo you have taken

--- task ---
Remove any background you don't want - this has a collage effect so don't be too neat!

Add this code so that the artwork sprite moves in the same way as the background.

```blocks3
+when flag clicked
+forever
set x to (move x)
set y to (move y)
```
--- /task ---

--- task ---
Resize and position the sprite. You can zoom in and out with the - and +. 

For best results position the artwork sprite at the edges of the paint window, so that your player sprite can explore the artwork further.
--- /task ---


--- task ---
Add text to tell the story of your artwork or images.

This can be playful. You could:

- write a few words about why you chose it
- describe it
- repeat and overlap words

Change the colours, size and position of the text.

Test it out! Your artwork sprite should move with the background.
