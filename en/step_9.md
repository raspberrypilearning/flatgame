## Add sound

*not edited vid yet*

Add sound to make it look a bit more life like. Test it out again and think of a sound that your background might make when the main sprite is walking accross it. 

For example, a background of leaves might make a crunch sound. 

--- task ---
On the sounds tab click choose a sound.

Hover over the play button to try out sounds until you find one that would work for a walking sound. Shorter sounds work best. 

When you have decided click on the sound to select it

The sounds are quite loud.

Add sound blocks to your code:

```blocks3
when flag clicked
go to [front v] layer
+forever
if <key (left arrow v) pressed> then
next costume
+play sound (Wood Tap v) until done
end
if <key (right arrow v) pressed> then
next costume
+play sound (Wood Tap v) until done
end
if <<key (up arrow v) pressed> or <key (up arrow v) pressed >> then
next costume
+play sound (Wood Tap v) until done
end
```
--- /task ---

Test it again - how does the sound work out? Is the direction ok? If you need to tweak volume or direction you can go back and change it in your code.
