## Adding artwork!

*not edited vid yet*

In this step you can get creative adding textures, drawings, stories, or any other artwork that you want to complete your flatgame.

--- task ---
Upload a new sprite and name it "artwork 1"

Use one of your drawings or a photo you have taken

--- task ---
Remove any background you don't want - this has a collage effect so don't be too neat!

Add code so that the artwork sprite moves in the same way as the background. This will be very similar to the background sprite code.

```blocks3
+when flag clicked
+forever
set x to (move x)
set y to (move y)
```
--- /task ---


--- task ---
Resize and position the image. You can zoom in and out with the - and +. 

For best resaults position the artwork sprite at the edges of the paint window, so that your main sprite can explore the artwork further.

If you move the image out of the paint window, make sure a small bit of it is still showing otherwise it will be hard to reposition if you want to edit later.

--- task ---
Add text to tell the story of your artwork or images.

This can be playful. You could:

- write a few words about why you chose it
- describe it
- repeat and overlap words

Change the colours, size and position of the text.

Again, if you move the text out of the paint window, make sure a small bit of it is still showing otherwise it will be hard to reposition if you want to edit later.

Test it out! Your artwork sprite should move with the background.
