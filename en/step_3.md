Start with a **theme**. Themes could be based on: 

- a place you like to visit
- something you like to do
- an object you like from home
- your favourite game

Or, make a flatgame theme based on right where you are. ðŸ‘€ Look around the room you are in, what do you notice, what is interesting or different about it?

Decide on a **theme** and, start drawing and crafting characters, backgrounds, objects or anything related.

With a tablet or phone take photos of your art. This will be the artwork you use for your game, try to take picture in focus and in a light room ðŸ“¸

You can also take close-up photos to add texture to your flatgame and take photos of things around you that you might want to include in the game.
