In the starter code on your background sprite, change the pull-down menu in the `switch costumes`{:class="block3looks"} block to say background:

```blocks3
when flag clicked
switch costume to (zoom v)
set size to [400]%
+switch costume to (background v)
go to [back v] layer
```

This is how we make the background sprite really big!
