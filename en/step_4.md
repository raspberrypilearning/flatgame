In the starter code change the switch the costumes. Your blocks should look like this:

```blocks3
when flag clicked
switch costume to (zoom v)
set size to [400]%
switch costume to (background v)
go to [back v] layer
```

The first switch is to zoom, and then to background. This is how we make the background sprite really big!
