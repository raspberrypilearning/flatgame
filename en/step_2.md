## Make the artwork!

Flatgames are very simple - they are a bit like a video game poetry so they don't need to make sense!

They start with making artwork on a theme. Themes could be based on: 

- a place you like to visit
- something you like to do
- your favourte game

Or, make a flatgame theme based on right where you are. 👀 Look around the room you are in, what do you notice, what is interesting or different about it?
