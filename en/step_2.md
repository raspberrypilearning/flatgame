## What is a Flatgame?

Flatgames are a bit like interactive artwork or poetry. They have very simple controls - where players move around a screen to explpre. To make one you start with crafting and use your hands to make art for the game. 

They are messy, and don't need to make sense!

Here is a flagame about a pebble beach and one about a pencil case!
