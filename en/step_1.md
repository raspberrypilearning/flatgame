## What you will make
Flatgames are a cross between a video game and poetry. 

They have very simple game controls - where a player moves around a screen to explpre artwork, drawings and cut-out collages. 

Here is a flatgame about a beach:

</div>
And a pencil case...

</div>
And one about a card game!
