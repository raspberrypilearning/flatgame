## What you will make
Flatgames are a cross between a video game and poetry. 

They have very simple game controls, where a player moves around a screen to explore artwork, drawings, and cut-out collages. 

Here is a flatgame about a beach:
<div class="scratch-preview">
 <iframe allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1200050605/embed?autostart=false" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>
This one gives an ant-size tour of a desk:

 <iframe allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1200050948/embed?autostart=false" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>
And this one is about a card game!

</div>
