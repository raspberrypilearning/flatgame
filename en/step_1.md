## What you will make

Flatgames are a cross between a game and a zine. To play you move a tiny character around larger-than-life artwork, under cut-outs of drawings and over collages of photos. 

Test out a flatgame here:
<div class="scratch-preview">
 <iframe allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1196985085/embed?autostart=false" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>

### You'll need:
🎨 drawing or crafting materials (pens, paper, scissors)
📷 a phone or tablet to take photos
👾 the Scratch [starter project](link)
