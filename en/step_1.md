## What is a Flatgame?
Flatgames are a cross between a video game and poetry. 

They have very simple game controls - where a player moves around a screen to explpre larger-than-life artwork, drawings and cut-out collages. They are messy, and don't need to make sense!

Here is a flagame about a pebble beach:
