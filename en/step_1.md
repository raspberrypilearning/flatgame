## What you will make

Flatgames are a cross between a game and a zine. You are a tiny character that moves around larger than life cut-outs and collages of drawing. They are purposfully quick and messy so that you can focus on getting creative! 

Test out a flatgame here:
<div class="scratch-preview">
 <iframe allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1196985085/embed?autostart=false" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>

### To start making the artwork you'll need:
ðŸŽ¨ drawing or crafting materials (pens, paper, scissors)
ðŸ“· a phone or tablet to take photos


### Did you know?
The original flatgame was made by game designer [Llaura McGee from Dreamfeel](https://dreamfeel.ie/) as a way to make more arty video games.
