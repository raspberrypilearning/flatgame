## What you will make

Flatgames are a cross between a game and a zine. A tiny character moves around larger than life artwork, under cut-outs of drawings and over collages of photos. They are messy so that you can focus on getting creative! 

Test out a flatgame here:
<div class="scratch-preview">
 <iframe allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1196985085/embed?autostart=false" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>

### You'll need:
ðŸŽ¨ drawing or crafting materials (pens, paper, scissors)
ðŸ“· a phone or tablet to take photos
ðŸ‘¾ the Scratch [starter project](link)

The original flatgame was made by Llaura McGee who is a game designer at [Dreamfeel](https://dreamfeel.ie/). They are a way to make more arty video games.
