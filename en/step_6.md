## Add a main sprite

The main sprite moves around the flatgame, checking out the different drawings and textures.

--- task ---
Upload a new sprite and name it main
--- /task ---

---task---
Use the eraser tool to remove any part of the image you don't want.

This doesn't have to be perfect - flatgames have a cutout collage effect, so it can be roughly done.

Change the size of the eraser tool for smaller details
---task/---

---task---
With the sprite tool select all and move to the centre
---/task---

---task---
Convert to Vector
---/task---

---task---
Use the select too to resize and rotate the sprite to how you want it. 

It should be quite small so that there is plenty of room on the stage around it.
---/task---

---task---
When you have your sprite exactly how you want it, right click and duplicate the costume.

Move the new costume and/or rotate it very slightly. This will animate it to make it look like it is moving.
